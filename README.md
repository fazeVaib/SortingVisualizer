*under progress*

This repo consists of the python scripts that can visualize the famous Sorting Algorithms and generate the animations using plotly.

### Sorting Algorithms Implemented
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort

### To Run

*currently it is implemented in jupter notebook, but will be shifted to web soon*

- Install plotly, python3, jupyter-notebook
- Set the amount of data you need to perform sorting on
- Uncomment the line containing the sorting you want to visualize
- Run the notebook


### TODO
- Implementing more algorithms
- Comparisons between algorithms
- Deploying on web using python web frameworks like Flask or Django
